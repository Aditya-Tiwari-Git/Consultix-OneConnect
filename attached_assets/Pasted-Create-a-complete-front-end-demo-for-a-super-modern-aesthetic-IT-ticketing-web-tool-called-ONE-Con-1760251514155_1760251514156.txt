Create a complete front-end demo for a super modern, aesthetic IT ticketing web tool called 'ONE Connect', heavily inspired by the provided screenshots. The demo must be built strictly using only HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

The application should have the following features:

Login System (Dummy):

A single login page with a toggle to select the user role: User, Support Team, or Vendor.

Users log in with a 'Cust ID' (e.g., CUST12345).

Support Team logs in with an 'Emp ID' (e.g., EMP54321).

Vendors log in with a 'Ven ID' (e.g., VEN98765).

Use dummy credentials for validation.

MFA & SMS Demo:

After a successful login, display a modal for a dummy MFA code (e.g., 'Enter code from your authenticator app').

Include a link to switch to a dummy SMS verification modal (e.g., 'Enter code sent to your mobile').

These modals should lead to the main dashboard upon 'verification'.

Main User Dashboard:

Design a two-column layout mirroring the provided screenshots.

Header: Include a logo, a prominent search bar, and a user profile icon.

Search Functionality: The search bar must filter a predefined list of catalog items, incident types, KB articles, and the user's past tickets in real-time.

Catalog & Ticket Creation:

Display a grid of "Popular topics" or "Catalog items" (e.g., 'Break-Fix Support', 'Access Request', 'Hardware Services') as cards.

When a user clicks a catalog item, a ticket creation modal should open with the category and title pre-filled.

Provide a button for the user to create a ticket manually, which opens the modal with blank fields.

User Information:

Display panels for 'My Active Items' (Tasks, Requests), 'My Assets' (showing dummy hardware), and a list of 'My Past Tickets'.

SLA Management:

Define separate dummy SLA resolution times for the Support Team and the Vendor Team.

Include three priority levels with distinct SLAs for each team:

High Priority: (e.g., Support: 4 hours, Vendor: 8 hours)

Medium Priority: (e.g., Support: 24 hours, Vendor: 48 hours)

Low Priority: (e.g., Support: 5 days, Vendor: 7 days)

When a ticket is created, automatically calculate and display the 'Resolution Due' date and time based on the priority and assigned team.

Design and Aesthetics:

Use the color palette from the screenshots (deep blues, purples, and vibrant gradients).

All elements like cards, buttons, and inputs should be modern with rounded corners, subtle shadows, and smooth hover effects.

Use a modern sans-serif font (like Poppins) and a comprehensive icon library (like Font Awesome) to match the visual style.

The entire experience should feel clean, professional, and intuitive.
